# Warm-up Project:
In a box bounded by [-1, 1], given m balloons(they cannot overlap) with variable radio r and position mu. And some tiny blocks are in the box at given position {d}; balloons cannot overlap with these blocks. find the optimal value of r and mu which maximizes 
sum r^2.
# Tasks:
+ found a team of 7.
+ write a user story.
+ break down the user story to tasks.
+ be familiar with git.
+ think out your algorithm to solve the problem.
+ write down your test cases.
+ start to code with Python.
+ use git to store your coding progress and document.
